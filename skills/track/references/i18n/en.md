# i18n catalogue — English (`en`)

Canonical key list for the tracking-file headings and template phrases the
`brace:track` skill writes. `fr.md` (and any future `<code>.md`) mirrors
this file: **same keys, same order**. A guard test enforces it.

**This file is the source of truth for the wording.** `SKILL.md`,
`references/writing-tracking-files.md` and `references/backlog-phases.md`
describe the *structure* of each file; wherever they name a heading, that
text must match a value here. When either side changes, reconcile the other.
`generate_portfolio.py` keeps its own `STRINGS` table (portfolio UI only) —
that one is not derived from this file.

**Never translated** (not listed here, kept verbatim in every language):
frontmatter keys and their enum values (`status: active|paused|blocked|archived`,
`"non"`, `"adopté"`, `"leger"`, `"superpowers"`), standard file names, hook
names, the tag `#tracker-sync`, language codes.

## ROADMAP.md

is running, `in_progress` and `after` replace it.
