# BRACE — track

## Overarching principle: never guess

Whenever a needed piece of information (the project's goal, its stack, the rationale for a decision, the content of a JOURNAL entry...) is missing or ambiguous: **ask the user**. Never infer, never invent plausible-looking content. A section with no answer stays marked "to fill in", never filled in by assumption.

## Asking questions

Assume the person answering is not a power user. Every question you put to them (adapt to the conversation, its language, and the host platform — see `references/platform-claude.md` for Claude Code and `references/platform-antigravity.md` for Antigravity):

- **Plain language.** No unexplained jargon. If a term is unavoidable (`frontmatter`, `remote`, `scope`), gloss it in the same sentence.
- **Say what each choice changes.** When the options have real consequences, give one short clause per option describing the effect — not just the label. The person should be able to choose without knowing the tool.
- **Recommend.** Mark one option **(recommended)** and base it on what you can see (the repo has a git remote, the `README` is in French, other tracked projects use a "Work" category, …). If nothing in the context points one way, say "no strong default" instead of a fake recommendation.
- Keep it to the decision at hand. One question per message; don't stack the bootstrap questions into one wall.

## Staying in the background

The skill's own bookkeeping should be invisible whenever there is nothing for
the user to decide or act on — the conversation stays focused on the user's
real topic, not on the tracker's housekeeping. Concretely:

- The session-opening staleness check (`last_updated` vs. real activity, see
  `## Continuous updates`) is silent when the files are current. Never say
  "the tracking files are up to date", "everything is current" or the
  equivalent — that's the default, expected state, not news worth a line.
  Speak up only when there is an actual proposal (files are stale → offer an
  update) or a real question to ask (see `## Detecting a project's root`).
- Same principle for any other purely-confirmatory check with nothing to
  report: do it, don't narrate it.
- This never applies to something the user needs to see or decide: a
  proposed update, a question, a commit offer, a collision between sessions,
  a glossary term added — all stay exactly as spec'd elsewhere. And file
  writes themselves can't be hidden (their diff shows in the transcript
  regardless) — that's fine; the point is not to add spoken narration on top
  of silent, nothing-to-report checks.

## Retroactive frontmatter questions

A recurring shape, used by `backlog_model`, `phase_model`, `category`, `glossary` (all in `## Detecting a project's root`) and `nested_model` (`## Sub-projects`): a frontmatter key that starts **absent** (never checked), gets resolved once by a signal-driven check, and — once genuinely answered — is **never asked again** automatically (changeable only on the user's explicit later request).

1. **Absent key** — the check has never run for this project.
2. **Signal detected** (a file pattern, an existing convention, a nested marker) — either auto-recognize silently, but only when the signal is unambiguous proof of an existing choice already made outside the skill (e.g. `ROADMAP.md` already referencing a `BACKLOG.md`), or **propose** and wait for an answer — never silently decide.
3. **One question, grouped if there are multiple candidates** at once — never one question per candidate (see `## Asking questions`).
4. **Write the answer, never ask again automatically.** A declined answer is recorded (typically `"non"`), not left absent, so the check doesn't re-run every session for nothing. An absent key after a check has run only makes sense when the check is meant to stay ongoing rather than one-time (see `## Sub-projects` for why `nested_model` is written even when nothing was adopted).

Any future retroactive key — including ones a skill built on `track` adds later (e.g. a `kind:` key) — follows this same shape rather than inventing its own.

## Scope

The file `~/.brace/scopes.txt` lists the covered roots (the old `~/.project-tracker/`, `~/.claude/project-tracker/` and `~/.gemini/project-tracker/` become symlinks to `~/.brace/` where present). The startup hook already only fires within that scope — but if the user invokes you explicitly in a folder outside any scope:
1. Warn them: "this folder is not in your automatic tracking scopes (`<list of scopes.txt entries>`)".
2. Carry on normally anyway — never act by refusing.
3. Offer to add a path to `scopes.txt` for the future: *"I'll add it to your scopes — this exact folder, or a parent path you'd rather specify?"*. If accepted, add the exact requested line to `~/.brace/scopes.txt`. If declined, add nothing and carry on.

## Detecting a project's root

The candidate root is the folder where the session was opened (`cwd`). Exception: if an ancestor of `cwd`, up to the scope root, already has a `docs/brace/STATUS.md` (or the legacy `docs/project-tracker/STATUS.md`), that ancestor is the tracked project's root (this avoids a false "new project" when a session is opened in a deep subfolder of an already-tracked project).

Three possible states:
- **Tracked**: `docs/brace/STATUS.md` present at the root found. A project still on the legacy `docs/project-tracker/` is tracked too; the session-start hook moves it to `docs/brace/` (see `## Moving from project-tracker`).
  - If its frontmatter has **no** `reminders_list` key at all (never asked — distinct from a key present with the value `"non"`, which means declined): ask the Reminders linking question right away, before anything else, regardless of whether a significant change happens in this session (see `references/reminders-sync.md`) — this question must never wait for a "Continuous updates" trigger.
  - If its frontmatter has no `backlog_model` key at all (see `## Retroactive frontmatter questions`): first check whether `ROADMAP.md` explicitly mentions/references a file named `BACKLOG.md` (at its standard location `docs/brace/BACKLOG.md`, or at a non-standard path elsewhere in the project — e.g. nested in a subfolder; do not require it to be at the standard location, look instead for the explicit mention) — if so, the project has already adopted the model without going through the BRACE bootstrap: write `backlog_model: "adopté"` directly, without asking; to decide whether to consolidate that file into `docs/brace/` or leave it where it is, see `## Retrofitting an existing project` (two cases depending on whether a `STATUS.md` of its own exists at that path). Otherwise, ask the Backlog/Roadmap model adoption question (see `references/backlog-phases.md`), once, never asked again afterwards.
  - If `backlog_model` is `"adopté"` (or was just auto-recognized above) and the frontmatter has no `phase_model` key at all (see `## Retroactive frontmatter questions`): check whether files matching `PHASE_N_SPEC.md` already exist in the project — if so, auto-recognize `phase_model: "leger"` without asking (same logic as above). Otherwise, do **not** ask a question here: `phase_model` stays absent until a phase is actually proposed (see `references/backlog-phases.md`, "How phases work").
  - If its frontmatter has **no** `category` key at all (see `## Retroactive frontmatter questions`): ask for a category the same way as bootstrap step 6 (*"A category, to group this with your other projects on the portfolio page"*, offering the ones already in use + "a new one" + "no category", recommending an existing one only on a clear match). Write the label to `category` (or `"non"`). Once written, never asked again.
  - If `docs/brace/GLOSSARY.md` does **not** exist and the frontmatter has no `glossary` key (see `## Retroactive frontmatter questions`): glance at the code and `README.md`; if the project carries a clear domain vocabulary of its own (coined terms, business jargon, common words used with a specific local meaning — not standard industry terms), propose starting `docs/brace/GLOSSARY.md` with the terms you spotted. If accepted, create it (leave `glossary` absent — the file's existence is the signal). If declined, write `glossary: "non"`. Once `GLOSSARY.md` exists **or** `glossary` is `"non"`, this proactive check never runs again — but the in-session triggers (`## Continuous updates`) still add terms, creating the file if needed.
  - If its frontmatter has **no** `nested_model` key at all (see `## Retroactive frontmatter questions`): run the one-time migration check (see `references/subprojects.md`, `### Detecting and attaching a sub-project`) — scan for sub-folders with their own `.git`, not already in `~/.brace/trackignore.txt` and not already in `subprojects:`, skipping the same dependency and build directories `generate_portfolio.py` prunes (never descend into `node_modules`, nor into any folder whose name starts with a dot). Once the check has been presented and answered (whatever the outcome — zero candidates found, some adopted, all declined), write `nested_model: "non"`. Never re-run automatically once written.
  - If `~/.brace/portfolio.txt` does not exist: ask where to save the portfolio page (*"`PORTFOLIO.html` is a single page listing all your tracked projects — where should it live?"*) — offer `~/Documents` **(recommended — tidy and permanent)**, `~/Desktop` (always in view), another folder, or "don't make one". Write the chosen folder path to `portfolio.txt`; for "don't make one" write a comments-only `portfolio.txt` (the hook stays silent). Machine-global, never asked again.
  - If `~/.brace/language.txt` does not exist: ask which language the tracking files and portfolio should be written in — **English** / **French**, recommending whichever the project's `README` is in (or, failing that, the language the user is writing to you in). Write the code (`en` / `fr`) to `language.txt`. Machine-global, never asked again.
  - Otherwise: resolve the effective language and glance at `STATUS.md`. If it is visibly in the other language, offer the full retranslation (see `references/writing-tracking-files.md`, `## Retranslating on a language change`).
  - If `~/.brace/prefs.txt` does not exist: ask once about the console view — see `## Console view preference` below — and write `prefs.txt`. Machine-global, never asked again. If `prefs.txt` says `console_view: chat-local` and the current project has no `.claude/settings.local.json` setting `defaultView`, apply it now (see that section).
  - These checks are independent of one another — ask them one after another rather than all at once in the same message.
  - If `cwd` matches (or is inside) a `path` listed in `subprojects:` with `tracked: true`: load that sub-project's own files (`## Sub-projects`) as immediate working context, in addition to the parent's own state — the session still opens on the parent's root (per the exception above), but the sub-project's `README.md`/`CHANGELOG.md`/`DECISIONS.md`/`ERRORS.md` (and its `ARCHITECTURE.md` if it has one) are read too, since that is very likely where the actual work will happen.
  - Then go to "Continuous updates".
- **Excluded**: the folder is ignored via `~/.brace/trackignore.txt` — either its own absolute path is a line there (an entry equal to a scope root ignores only that exact folder, not the projects inside it), or a non-scope-root ancestor is. → do nothing, unless the user brings it up explicitly.
  - If the user brings it up **to ask for it to be tracked** ("track this", "let's track this one"):
    - If the folder's **own path** is the `trackignore.txt` line: offer to remove that line, then go to "Bootstrapping a new project". (Symmetric with bootstrap step 1, which adds the line on a declined setup.)
    - If it is an **ancestor** that is ignored (the folder's own path is not a line): explain plainly that a parent folder is on the skip list, so there's no way to track just this one without also un-skipping everything else under that parent. Offer: **remove the parent from the skip list** (then bootstrap this folder — but every project under that parent becomes eligible for tracking too), or **leave it as is** *(recommended unless you do want the whole subtree tracked)*.
  - If the user brings it up for anything else: unchanged — do nothing about the tracking state.
- **New/unknown**: neither → go to "Bootstrapping a new project".

When you are invoked via the `SessionStart` hook reminder, it already tells you which of these three states applies (with the content of `STATUS.md` where relevant) — no need to re-detect it yourself in that case.

The hook reminder is an **instruction, not a suggestion**: run the check (and any question it triggers) automatically, in the session's first reply, even when the user's opening request is about something else. Never defer it with "the hook suggests X, tell me if you want me to do it", and never wait for the user to bring it up. The user's request is handled alongside it, not instead of it. What still needs the user's say is only what this skill already makes conditional — the *content* of a proposed update, a question, a commit — not whether the check itself happens.

## Bootstrapping a new project

A sequence of questions, one at a time (see `## Asking questions`), never an assumption:

1. **On an untracked project this is the session's opening move — asked automatically, before responding to anything else. The user never has to request it.** (An *excluded* project stays silent — tracking there starts only if the user raises it, see the **Excluded** bullet under `## Detecting a project's root`.) Ask via `AskUserQuestion` (selectable choices, not prose). Intent:
   *"I can keep a small set of notes files for this project — what it does, current status, a changelog, decisions — updated as we work, so the context is always in one place. Set that up here?"*
   - **Yes, set it up** *(recommended when the folder holds a real project — source files, a git repo, a README)* → a few quick questions, then the files are created (step 2).
   - **No, don't ask again** → this folder is added to the skip list (`trackignore.txt`); never offered again.
   - **Not now** → nothing is written; you'll be asked again next time you open a session here.
2. *"What is this project for? One or two sentences."* → feeds the `README` intro and the first `STATUS.md`.
3. *"What's it built with — main languages, frameworks, key tools?"*
4. *"How is this project's code version-controlled?"* — offer:
   - **Already on GitHub (or another git remote)** *(recommended if the folder has a `.git` with a remote set)* → ask for the URL if it isn't already configured; the tracking files get committed alongside the code.
     ```bash
     git init   # if not already a repo
     git remote add origin <url>
     git fetch origin
     ```
     - Remote is empty → nothing more; the first commit/push follows the normal flow below.
     - Remote already has files → attempt a merge (`git merge --allow-unrelated-histories origin/main` or the default branch). On a path conflict, don't decide it yourself: show it and ask how to reconcile (*keep the local copy* / *keep what's on the remote* / *I'll merge them by hand*).
   - **Create a new private GitHub repo now** → ask *"Name for the new repo? (default: the folder's name)"*. Needs `gh` logged in:
     ```bash
     gh auth status   # check first
     ```
     If `gh` is missing or logged out: say so plainly, skip the GitHub part, carry on with the rest of the bootstrap.
     If OK:
     ```bash
     cd <project root>
     git init   # if not already a repo
     gh repo create <name> --private --source=. --remote=origin
     ```
     After the standard files are created, ask *"Push this first commit to GitHub now?"* *(recommended: yes)* before any `git push`.
   - **No version control** *(recommended if there's no `.git` and you don't want one)* → skip the whole GitHub part; record `uses_git: false` in `AGENTS.md` so it's never asked again; staleness is then judged from file dates instead of `git log`.
5. *"Do you want your next actions to also show up in the macOS Reminders app, so you see them outside your editor?"* — optional.
   - **Yes** *(recommended only if this machine already has the Reminders integration and your other tracked projects use it)* → a Reminders list is created or linked, and its tasks stay in sync with the "next actions" here.
   - **No** *(the low-friction default)* → the next actions live in the tracking files only.
   - If the `reminders_lists` tool fails because the `apple-reminders` MCP server isn't installed: handle as "MCP tool unavailable" in `references/reminders-sync.md` step 0 (offer to install it, `user` scope) — don't block the bootstrap over it.
   - Yes + an existing list already fits (`reminders_lists` action `read`) → offer to reuse it rather than make a new one.
   - Yes + no list fits → ask *"Name for the Reminders list? (default: the project's name)"*, then create it flat (`reminders_lists` action `create`) — the tool can't file it into a Reminders folder, the user does that themselves.
   - Either way, write the answer to the `reminders_list` frontmatter (the list name, or `"non"` if declined — never an empty string). Never asked again. See `references/reminders-sync.md`.
6. *"A category for this project? It groups it with your other projects on the portfolio page (e.g. Work, Personal, a client name)."* — read the `category` values already used by the other tracked projects (walk the `scopes.txt` roots) and offer them for reuse, plus "a new one" and "no category". *(Recommend an existing category if the project's nature clearly matches one; otherwise no strong default.)* Write the label to the `category` frontmatter (or `"non"` for none). Never asked again for this project.
7. *"Is this project big or intricate enough to want a separate architecture document, or is a short orientation paragraph in `AGENTS.md` enough?"*
   - **`AGENTS.md` is enough** *(recommended for most projects)* → a one-paragraph orientation, no extra file.
   - **A separate `ARCHITECTURE.md`** *(recommended only for a genuinely large system — many modules or services)* → a full doc: components, boundaries, data flow.
   (`GLOSSARY.md` is **not** asked here — it appears later, on first need; see `## Detecting a project's root` and `## Continuous updates`.)

First run `mkdir -p docs/brace/` at the project root, then create the standard files (next section) filled in with the answers obtained — never invented content for anything that wasn't answered. `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` go at the project root (with symlink `ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md`); the 7 other standard files in `docs/brace/` (see the next section for the per-file detail). `project:` in the frontmatter is always the folder's own name — never asked. The frontmatter of the `STATUS.md` thus created immediately includes `backlog_model: "adopté"`, written automatically along with the other fields — never asked as a question at this stage, since `BACKLOG.md` is one of the standard files created unconditionally (see next section).

If `~/.brace/portfolio.txt` does not exist yet (first tracked project on this machine), ask where the unified portfolio should go — `~/Desktop`, `~/Documents`, or another folder — and write the chosen folder path to `portfolio.txt`, so `PORTFOLIO.html` is generated from this first project. See the `portfolio.txt` bullet under `## Detecting a project's root`.

Likewise, if `~/.brace/language.txt` does not exist, ask once which language the tracking files and portfolio should use (English / French) and write the code to `language.txt`. The bootstrap then creates every file in that language (consult `references/i18n/<code>.md` when it is not `en`). No per-project `language:` key is written at bootstrap — it exists only as an explicit override set later via `/brace:config`.

And if `~/.brace/prefs.txt` does not exist, ask the console-view question once (see `## Console view preference`) and write `prefs.txt`.

Once `README.md` (and `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `GLOSSARY.md` if you created them) are written, run the fresh-eyes readability pass on each — see `references/writing-tracking-files.md` (`## The fresh-eyes readability pass`).

## The standard files

Nine files for each tracked project. `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` at the project root (with `CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md` symlink for Anthropic auto-discovery); the 7 others in `docs/brace/`:

| File | Content | Cadence |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md` (root) | What, why, stack, install/run, links (repo, docs) | Rare |
| `docs/brace/ROADMAP.md` | Prioritised synthesis derived from `BACKLOG.md`: past phases, current phase, anticipated phases — never the raw detail. See `references/backlog-phases.md` | Occasional |
| `docs/brace/STATUS.md` | Snapshot of the current state (what works/breaks, 3 next actions) + machine-readable frontmatter (see below). **Fully rewritten**, does not accumulate | Every session / significant change |
| `docs/brace/JOURNAL.md` | Dated chronological log of sessions: what was done, why | **Append-only**, every significant session |
| `docs/brace/CHANGELOG.md` | Keep a Changelog format (Added/Changed/Fixed) per version | Every shippable change |
| `AGENTS.md` (root) | Instructions for you: code conventions, build/test commands, known pitfalls, architecture summary, the project's git/GitHub choices (symlinked from `CLAUDE.md`) | When conventions change |
| `docs/brace/DECISIONS.md` | Why one technical choice over another, alternatives rejected | **Append-only**, one entry per structural decision |
| `docs/brace/ERRORS.md` | Bug encountered → cause → fix, searchable | **Append-only**, every significant resolved bug |
| `docs/brace/BACKLOG.md` | Raw, complete reservoir of every envisaged idea/feature (effort, perceived value). Never purged, enriched and archived. See `references/backlog-phases.md` | **Append-only** (archiving, never purging) |

Three optional files, all in `docs/brace/`:
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — created at bootstrap (step 7) if the project is complex enough.
- `GLOSSARY.md` — **created on first need**, not at bootstrap (see `## Detecting a project's root` for the proactive check, `## Continuous updates` for the in-session triggers).
- `SUBPROJECTS.md` — **created on first need**, the moment a first sub-project is attached (see `## Sub-projects`).

How to write each of these well — reader, structure, what belongs and what does not, worked good/poor examples: see `references/writing-tracking-files.md`. Consult it whenever you create or substantially rewrite one of these files.

**These files are committed like any other source** — they are the project's memory, `CHANGELOG.md` / `DECISIONS.md` / `ROADMAP.md` are standard public artifacts, and the concurrent-session safeguard below relies on `git diff` seeing `STATUS.md`. Do not add them to `.gitignore`. The only exception: on a public repo whose `STATUS.md` / `JOURNAL.md` / `BACKLOG.md` would carry genuinely sensitive content (unreleased strategy, client names), those three may be ignored while `CHANGELOG.md` / `DECISIONS.md` / `ROADMAP.md` stay committed — never the default, only on request.

### `STATUS.md` frontmatter

```yaml
---
project: <folder name>   # always the folder's own name
status: active            # active | paused | blocked | archived
uses_git: true            # or false depending on the bootstrap choice
repo: https://github.com/<user>/<repo>   # empty if not applicable
stack: [Python, FastAPI, ...]
last_updated: <YYYY-MM-DD>
next_milestone: "<free text>"
reminders_list: "<Reminders list name>"   # "non" if declined, absent if never asked
category: "<free text>"   # "non" if the user declined a category, absent if never asked
backlog_model: "adopté"   # automatic at bootstrap; "non" only possible via a declined retrofit; absent only for a project tracked before this feature and not yet retrofitted
phase_model: "superpowers"   # or "leger"; absent if no phase ever proposed
language: fr              # en | fr ; absent = inherit language.txt
glossary: "non"           # "non" = proactive glossary scan declined; absent = not yet checked; unset once GLOSSARY.md exists
subprojects:               # absent = no sub-projects; see ## Sub-projects
  - name: "<folder name>"
    path: "<path relative to this project's root>"
    tracked: true           # true = has its own README/CHANGELOG/(ARCHITECTURE)/DECISIONS/ERRORS; false = just listed
    git: true               # true if it has its own, fully independent git repo — no relation to this project's git
    status: active          # active | archived
nested_model: "non"         # "non" = the one-time migration check has run for this project; absent = not yet run
---
```

This is the only strictly structured part of any of these files — the rest is free narrative. This frontmatter is what `generate_portfolio.py` consumes for the portfolio (see below): `project`, `status` and `last_updated` are mandatory, without them the project is simply omitted from the portfolio.

`language` is an optional per-project override for the tracking files' language (not the portfolio, not reminders); absent means follow `~/.brace/language.txt`.

`subprojects` and `nested_model` are documented in full in `## Sub-projects` (and `references/subprojects.md`) and `## Detecting a project's root` — `generate_portfolio.py` reads the `subprojects` key to render each project's detail sub-page (see `## Portfolio`); the aggregate `PORTFOLIO.html` card grid does not use it.

## Sub-projects

A tracked project can chaperone one or more **sub-projects**: sub-folders that each hold a genuine project of their own (an app, a module, a version) — never just any sub-folder used to store something. They are recorded in the parent's `subprojects:` frontmatter list (`### STATUS.md frontmatter`). This is purely an organisational concept of this skill, not a git relationship, and a sub-project cannot itself have sub-projects.

The full rules — the states (`tracked`, `git`, `status`), the fixed file set of a tracked sub-project, `SUBPROJECTS.md`, detection and attaching, the one-time `nested_model` migration check — are in `references/subprojects.md`. **Read it before** attaching a sub-project, creating or updating a sub-project's files, or running that migration check. In-session trigger, no scan involved: if, in the course of normal work, you see that a sub-folder has its own `.git`, or the user mentions or creates a new sub-project of theirs, make the attach proposal described there.

## Output language

Everything the skill *writes into a project's tracking files* follows a
resolved **effective language**:

1. `language:` in that project's `STATUS.md` frontmatter, if present;
2. else `~/.brace/language.txt` (machine-global);
3. else `en`.

`PORTFOLIO.html` follows the `language:` line of `portfolio.txt` if present,
else `language.txt`, else `en`. Reminders items you create follow
`language.txt` (global) — never the per-project override. The **chat** (the
questions you ask, the discussion) always follows the language the user is
writing in this session — it is not driven by any of these settings.

Supported: `en`, `fr`. Machine values are never translated in any language:
frontmatter keys and enum values (`status: active|paused|…`, `"non"`,
`"adopté"`, `"leger"`, `"superpowers"`), file names, hook names,
`#tracker-sync`, the language codes.

**When the effective language is not `en`:** before creating or rewriting a
tracking file, read `references/i18n/<code>.md` and use its section headings
and template phrases verbatim; write all free prose in that language. `en.md`
holds the English originals.

**When the effective language changed** and the project already has content
in the old language (you notice it by glancing at `STATUS.md` — `en` vs `fr`
is unambiguous): propose the full retranslation — see
`references/writing-tracking-files.md` (`## Retranslating on a language change`).

## Console view preference

This skill rewrites several Markdown files per session, which fills the
transcript with edit diffs. Asked once per machine (when `prefs.txt` is
absent — see `## Detecting a project's root`), never again:

> *"BRACE updates several tracking files each session — that fills
> the transcript with edit diffs. Fold Claude Code's view to the condensed
> 'chat' mode? It hides tool activity (reversible in `/config`, and `Ctrl+O`
> toggles it live)."*

Offer three choices, via `AskUserQuestion`:

- **Only in tracked projects** *(recommended — folds the noise exactly where
  it happens, leaves your other work untouched)* → in the current project,
  merge `{"defaultView": "chat"}` into `.claude/settings.local.json` (create
  it if missing) and make sure `.claude/settings.local.json` is in that
  project's `.gitignore`. Write `console_view: chat-local` to `prefs.txt`. On
  every later bootstrap of a new tracked project, apply the same local
  setting there (checked in `## Detecting a project's root`).
- **Everywhere** → the condensed view in *all* your Claude Code sessions.
  Merge `"defaultView": "chat"` into `~/.claude/settings.json` (read it
  first, never clobber). Write `console_view: chat-global` to `prefs.txt`.
- **No** → leave the view as it is. Write `console_view: full` to `prefs.txt`;
  mention `/config` and `Ctrl+O` once, then drop it.

`prefs.txt` is machine-global config (same family as `scopes.txt` /
`portfolio.txt` / `language.txt`): `key: value` per line, `#` comments. Its
existence is the "already asked" signal. Changed later via
`/brace:config`.

## Continuous updates

When you judge that you have made a significant change in a session (new feature, important fix, an architecture decision settled):
1. Re-read `STATUS.md` as it is right now (never a version seen earlier in the session), then rewrite it (state + 3 next actions, frontmatter up to date including `last_updated`). Write it in the project's effective language (see `## Output language`); if that is not `en`, consult `references/i18n/<code>.md` for the headings.
2. Add a dated entry to `JOURNAL.md` (a real append — do not open the whole file to rewrite it, just add the new entry at the end).
3. Where relevant: add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (shippable change), `DECISIONS.md` (technical choice settled), or `ERRORS.md` (bug resolved) — always by appending, never by rewriting the whole file.
4. If `uses_git: true` and there are uncommitted changes lying around, point it out and offer a commit (conventional commits message) — never commit/push without explicit confirmation.
5. For every `active`, `tracked: true` sub-project (`## Sub-projects`) — checked from the parent's session, never via a hook:
   - With its own git (`git: true`): if there are uncommitted changes, point it out and offer a commit **scoped to that sub-project's own repo** (same conventional-commit confirmation rule as step 4); separately, compare its `CHANGELOG.md`'s latest dated entry to its own `git log` — if code has moved since, mention it, same spirit as the parent's own staleness check.
   - Without its own git (`git: false`): no commit offer (nothing to commit), but still compare its `CHANGELOG.md`'s latest dated entry to the sub-project's own file modification dates — the same fallback already used when the parent itself is `uses_git: false`.
   - `tracked: false` or `archived` sub-projects: no check at all.
   The parent's own `uses_git` plays no role in any of this — a parent with `uses_git: false` chaperoning sub-projects that each have their own git repo is the expected shape, not a special case.
6. The Reminders sync itself is no longer triggered here (see `references/reminders-sync.md` — a `PostToolUse` hook handles it on the first change to `docs/brace/STATUS.md`/`docs/brace/ROADMAP.md` of each session (one reminder per session and per project)); the linking question, for a project that has never had it, is asked earlier — see `## Detecting a project's root` — not here.

This trigger (judging a change to be "significant") is your own judgment, not a mechanical rule. Safety net: the user can ask you for an update explicitly at any time — in that case, check the real state before writing anything (do not rewrite if nothing has actually changed since the last `last_updated`).

**Substantive discussions — logged independently of the "significant change" judgment above.** A design or scoping discussion is itself a trackable project event, even when no decision is reached and even if the idea is later dropped — nothing discussed should be lost just because it was never acted on. When a real back-and-forth about direction (a feature, an approach, a trade-off) reaches a natural end point — the topic visibly wraps up, the conversation moves to something else, or the session ends — append one `JOURNAL.md` entry summarising what was discussed and what stayed open, marking clearly that nothing is decided or built; capture anything actionable as a `BACKLOG.md` item. Do this automatically, never ask permission first. One entry per *concluded* topic, not one per exchange — never log mid-discussion and again minutes later for the same topic; if the user reopens the same topic later in the session, that is a new entry, not a duplicate of the first.

**Anti-duplication with sub-projects.** When a project has any entry in `subprojects:`, `STATUS.md`/`JOURNAL.md`/`ROADMAP.md` on the parent stay about the *global* picture only: at most a one-line-per-sub-project summary plus a pointer to `SUBPROJECTS.md` or the sub-project's own `CHANGELOG.md` — never the sub-project's own detail copied in. `DECISIONS.md`/`ERRORS.md` on the parent likewise cover only genuinely transverse/global decisions and bugs once a sub-project is `tracked: true` — that sub-project's own `DECISIONS.md`/`ERRORS.md` (`## Sub-projects`) is where its own history belongs.

**`GLOSSARY.md` — in-session triggers.** Independent of the "significant change" judgment above. When either happens, add the term to `docs/brace/GLOSSARY.md` — **create the file if it does not exist, with that first entry, and say so** (no separate question for a single term); if `glossary` was `"non"`, drop the key, the file now exists:
- the user asks what a **project-specific** term means (coined term, jargon, a common word used with a specific local meaning — not a standard industry term): answer, then add it, with the project meaning + where it shows up + a short usage example;
- a project-specific term keeps coming up undefined while you work.
Format and what to include/exclude: `references/writing-tracking-files.md` (`## GLOSSARY.md`).

**Onboarding files — fresh-eyes readability pass.** If this session substantially rewrote or restructured an onboarding file (`README.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `GLOSSARY.md` — not a targeted edit), run the fresh-eyes readability pass on it before finishing: `references/writing-tracking-files.md` (`## The fresh-eyes readability pass`). Advisory, never a gate.

### Collisions between concurrent sessions

The user often works with several AI assistant sessions (Claude Code, Antigravity) open in parallel on the same project. Before rewriting `STATUS.md` (or any file rewritten in full rather than accumulated):
- If `uses_git: true`: just before writing, check whether there is an uncommitted diff on this file that does not come from this session (`git diff -- docs/brace/STATUS.md`). If so, do not overwrite: show the diff to the user and ask how to merge the two updates rather than deciding it yourself.
- Without git: compare the file's modification date with the one seen at your last read; if it has changed in the meantime, same handling (show, ask).

For `JOURNAL.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `ERRORS.md`, `BACKLOG.md`: the write must always be a genuine append at the end of the file (or a targeted update of an existing item, e.g. ticking `[x]`) — never a "re-read everything / rewrite everything" cycle — so that two sessions each appending an entry in parallel do not overwrite one another.

## Reminders sync

If `reminders_list` (in the `STATUS.md` frontmatter) is linked (present, different from `"non"`): see `references/reminders-sync.md` for the trigger (hook + full diff + backfill), the `#tracker-sync` tag, the priority mapping, subtasks, and the consistency safeguard. The linking question itself is asked elsewhere — see `## Bootstrapping a new project` (step 5) and `## Detecting a project's root`. Items you create in the Reminders app are written in the machine-global `language.txt` language, not the per-project override.

## Portfolio

A `PostToolUse` hook (`skills/track/hooks/post_tool_use.sh`, called by the dispatcher `dispatch/run.sh`) regenerates `PORTFOLIO.html` automatically on every `STATUS.md` write, into the folder configured by `~/.brace/portfolio.txt` (a single file, all scopes aggregated). Each project also gets its own detail page under `portfolio/<project>.html`, linked from its card — the hook regenerates only the one sub-page for the project whose `STATUS.md` just changed (`PORTFOLIO.html` itself is always rebuilt in full). **Never run `generate_portfolio.py` yourself** — except once, with the user's approval, right after they change the portfolio folder, title or language via `/brace:config`: that run has no single "changed project", so it regenerates every sub-page too. If `portfolio.txt` does not exist yet, see the `portfolio.txt` bullet under `## Detecting a project's root`.

`portfolio.txt` holds the output **folder** on its first line that is neither a `title:` nor a `language:` line (a line ending in `.html` is taken as an explicit file path instead); `~`/`$VAR` are expanded. An optional `title:` line anywhere in the file sets the portfolio heading (default, locale-dependent: "My projects" / "Mes projets"); an optional `language:` line (`en`/`fr`) overrides the portfolio's output language. All three are edited via `/brace:config`, never written by this skill directly.

Projects are grouped into sections by the `category` frontmatter field — uncategorized first, then categories ordered by most recent activity.

The `subprojects:` frontmatter key (`## Sub-projects`) is rendered on a project's own detail sub-page (`portfolio/<project>.html`): each **active** sub-project is listed by name, whether it is `tracked` (plus its own latest `CHANGELOG.md` date, when available) or just `listed`; archived sub-projects are excluded in v1. The aggregate `PORTFOLIO.html` card grid itself still doesn't surface sub-project info — that remains a separate, still-open piece of work.

To change the portfolio location, title or language, or any config (scopes, ignored paths, output language, a project's category), the user runs `/brace:config`.

## Moving from project-tracker

BRACE was called project-tracker before 1.0. The move is automatic and
permanent — nothing for you to start:

- **Machine** (session-start hook, every session, silent when done): the old
  `project-tracker` plugin is replaced by `brace` in every tool on the
  machine (Claude Code, Antigravity), and `~/.project-tracker/` becomes
  `~/.brace/`. When the hook says a plugin was replaced, tell the user in
  one line to restart and close every other open session. When it says
  the user is now on BRACE, tell them once that `/project-tracker:config`
  is now `/brace:config` and the skill is `brace:track`.
- **Project** (first session in each project once no old plugin remains):
  the hook moves `docs/project-tracker/` to `docs/brace/` and rewrites the
  path in `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, a real `CLAUDE.md` and `STATUS.md` —
  never in `JOURNAL.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `ERRORS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` or
  `BACKLOG.md` (they were true at their date). Announce it in one line and
  offer a commit under the usual rule; never commit on your own.
- **Same session as a plugin swap**: in a session where a plugin was just
  replaced, the project stays on `docs/project-tracker/` until the next
  session — keep reading and writing that folder meanwhile.
- **Both folders present**: never merge them yourself — show the user what
  each holds and ask, as for a collision between sessions.

## Skills built on BRACE

`track` is the base layer. Other skills (the first planned: `design`)
plug into it without touching it — see `references/skills-contract.md`.
They start on demand, from their description or as `/brace:<skill>`,
never with an activation question.

## Retrofitting an existing project

When the project already has non-standard tracking files (e.g. `.pages` files, an `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `JOURNAL.md` already present): treat it as a bootstrap, but reuse what already exists rather than asking the questions from scratch. If a source doc is not readable as plain text (Apple `.pages`, a zip): say so plainly and offer — *"I can't read `<file>` directly. Export it to text/Markdown/PDF for me, or should I just start fresh from the setup questions?"* *(recommend exporting if the file clearly holds real history worth keeping; otherwise starting fresh)*.

### Retrofitting the Backlog/Roadmap/Phases model

An already-tracked project may have its own `BACKLOG.md` (and sometimes `PHASE_N_SPEC.md` files) at a non-standard path, set up before this feature existed in BRACE. Two cases to tell apart by whether or not a `STATUS.md` of its own exists in that subfolder:
- **A `STATUS.md` of its own exists in that subfolder**: it is a separately tracked project (its own root, its own `docs/brace/`) — never merge its content into the enclosing project.
- **No `STATUS.md` of its own**: these are orphan detail files (not a tracking identity of their own) — consolidate them into the enclosing project's `docs/brace/` rather than leaving them where they are.

The auto-recognition (see `## Detecting a project's root`) only fires if `ROADMAP.md` explicitly references that `BACKLOG.md` (whatever its path) — otherwise, ask the question normally, even if a `BACKLOG.md` exists somewhere in the project with no explicit link from `ROADMAP.md` (do not guess that it plays that role).

If the question is asked and accepted for a project that already has a `ROADMAP.md` and/or existing tracking content (e.g. a home-grown `docs/BACKLOG.md`, or a `ROADMAP.md` that already lists loose ideas): do not create an empty file alongside it — discuss with the user to summarize/reformat what already exists according to the structure in `references/backlog-phases.md`, case by case, rather than applying a generic script.
