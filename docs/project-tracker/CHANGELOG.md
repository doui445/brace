# Changelog — project-tracker

All notable changes to this project. Format based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

**Versioning.** A `0.x` project — `major` stays `0` until the skill is declared
stable. `minor` (`0.N.0`) = a new command, hook, config knob or standard file,
or any change to how the skill behaves. `patch` (`0.x.N`) = fixes, docs and
guidance, no-behaviour-change refactors. The version lives in
`plugin.json` / `marketplace.json` (kept equal); the release routine is in
`AGENTS.md` § Releasing.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.13.0] — 2026-10-04

### Added
- **Native Antigravity (AGY) support:**
  - `platforms/antigravity/plugin.json` and `platforms/antigravity/hooks.json` manifests.
  - `platforms/antigravity/hooks/session_start.sh` (`PreInvocation` hook for scope & tracking detection).
  - `platforms/antigravity/hooks/portfolio_regen.sh` (`PostToolUse` hook on file edit/write).
  - `platforms/antigravity/hooks/reminders_sync_trigger.sh` (`PostToolUse` hook).
  - Complete test suites for Antigravity hooks (`test_agy_session_start.sh`, `test_agy_portfolio_regen.sh`).
  - `install-antigravity.sh` one-shot installer for Antigravity plugin.
- **Unified config directory:**
  - Canonical config moved to `~/.project-tracker/` with symlinks from `~/.claude/project-tracker` and `~/.gemini/project-tracker`.
  - Migration script `skills/track/scripts/migrate_config.sh` and its test suite `test_migrate_config.sh`.
- **Platform reference guides:**
  - `skills/track/references/platform-claude.md` (Claude-specific tooling: `AskUserQuestion`, hooks format, console views).
  - `skills/track/references/platform-antigravity.md` (Antigravity-specific tooling: `ask_question`, hooks protocol, silent `PostToolUse`).

### Changed
- **`AGENTS.md` pivot:** `AGENTS.md` is now the canonical root instructions file for all tracked projects (compatible with Antigravity, OpenAI Codex, Copilot, Cursor). `CLAUDE.md` is preserved as a symlink pointing to `AGENTS.md` for Anthropic tooling compatibility.
- **`generate_portfolio.py` config resolution:** looks up `~/.project-tracker` first, then falls back to `~/.claude/project-tracker` or `~/.gemini/project-tracker`.
- **`SKILL.md` neutralisation:** platform-agnostic wording, references `AGENTS.md` and links to platform-specific references for tool invocation details.

## [0.12.2] — 2026-09-19

### Changed
- **`SKILL.md` slimmed down (no behaviour change).** The `## Sub-projects`
  subsystem moved to `references/subprojects.md` (same pattern as
  `backlog-phases.md`), leaving a short pointer and the in-session attach
  trigger in `SKILL.md` (386 → 335 lines). The frontmatter `description`
  now states trigger conditions only instead of listing the nine tracked
  files.

## [0.12.1] — 2026-09-19

### Fixed
- **Session-start check no longer deferred.** The `SessionStart` hook said
  "propose an update if needed", which Claude could read as optional and
  postpone (asking the user first) when the session opened on an unrelated
  request. The hook message and `SKILL.md` now state the check is automatic
  and runs in the first reply, alongside the user's request.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-09-19

### Added
- **Nested tracking.** A tracked project can now chaperone **sub-projects**:
  sub-folders that each hold a genuine project of their own, detected via a
  nested `.git` and attached through the same 3-way choice used for
  top-level projects. An attached sub-project is either just listed
  (`tracked: false`) or given its own small file set — `README.md`,
  `CHANGELOG.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `ERRORS.md` always, plus optional
  `ARCHITECTURE.md`, all flat at its own root — recorded in the parent's new
  `subprojects:` frontmatter list. A new `SUBPROJECTS.md` (created on first
  need, like `GLOSSARY.md`) gives one section per sub-project; the parent's
  own `STATUS.md`/`JOURNAL.md`/`ROADMAP.md` stay global rather than
  duplicating sub-project detail. A one-time `nested_model` migration check
  scans already-tracked projects for pre-existing git sub-repos to offer for
  attachment. Opening a session inside a `tracked: true` sub-project now
  loads its files as extra context alongside the parent's; each active,
  `tracked: true` sub-project gets its own commit-offer / freshness check,
  independent of the parent's own `uses_git`.
- **Substantive discussions are always logged.** A design or scoping
  discussion is now itself a trackable event: `SKILL.md` logs it to
  `JOURNAL.md` (plus `BACKLOG.md` for anything actionable) at its natural
  conclusion, even when no decision was reached or the idea was later
  dropped — independent of the existing "significant change" trigger.
- **Portfolio: a detail sub-page per project.** Each project's card in
  `PORTFOLIO.html` now links to its own `portfolio/<project>.html`,
  rendering its `STATUS.md` state and next actions, current `ROADMAP.md`
  phase, recent `JOURNAL.md` activity, latest `CHANGELOG.md` version, and a
  direct GitHub link. `portfolio_regen.sh` regenerates only the changed
  project's sub-page on a `STATUS.md` write; a manual/config-triggered run
  regenerates all of them, with orphaned sub-pages cleaned up.

### Changed
- **The skill stays quiet when there's nothing to report.** New
  `## Staying in the background` principle in `SKILL.md`: the session-opening
  staleness check no longer announces "tracking files are up to date" —
  silence is the default, and the skill speaks up only for an actual
  proposal, question, or something the user needs to see.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-09-01

### Changed
- **Every question the skill asks is now written for a non-technical user.**
  New `## Asking questions` principle in `SKILL.md` (plain language; one line
  per option on what it changes; a context-based **(recommended)** hint). The
  bootstrap questions (git handling, Reminders, category, `ARCHITECTURE.md`),
  the first-run config questions (portfolio location, language, console
  view), the phase / `superpowers` / backlog-model prompts, retranslation and
  the un-exclude prompt are all reworded to match.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-09-01

### Added
- **Console-view preference.** The skill rewrites several files a session,
  filling the transcript with edit diffs. It now asks once per machine
  whether to fold Claude Code's view to the condensed "chat" mode —
  **Everywhere** (`~/.claude/settings.json`), **Only in tracked projects**
  (each project's `.claude/settings.local.json`, gitignored), or **No**. The
  answer lives in `~/.claude/project-tracker/prefs.txt` (`console_view:`),
  changeable via `/project-tracker:config`.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-08-31

### Changed
- **The skill is renamed `track`** — invoked `project-tracker:track` instead
  of the redundant `project-tracker:project-tracker`. `skills/project-tracker/`
  → `skills/track/`; `hooks.json`, the installer and the doc paths follow.
  The plugin name (`project-tracker`), the `/project-tracker:config` command,
  the `~/.claude/project-tracker/` config dir and the `docs/project-tracker/`
  output folder are all unchanged. If you ever typed
  `/project-tracker:project-tracker`, use `/project-tracker:track` now.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-08-31

### Changed
- **Untracked project → the tracking question is asked automatically.** The
  `SessionStart` hook on a new folder now instructs Claude to open the
  session with a selectable **Yes / No, don't ask again / Not now** prompt
  (`AskUserQuestion`), instead of a passive "not tracked" note the user had
  to act on. "No" adds the folder to `trackignore.txt`; "Not now" writes
  nothing and the prompt returns next session. Excluded folders are
  unchanged — silent unless the user raises it.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-08-31

### Fixed
- `docs/project-tracker/JOURNAL.md` carried an absolute home path in the
  first bootstrap entry — genericised.
- `ROADMAP.md` was four releases stale (stuck at the v0.3.0 era) — rewritten
  to cover v0.4.0–v0.7.0.
- `CLAUDE.md` layout section listed only two reference files — added
  `writing-tracking-files.md` and `references/i18n/`; fixed the
  `test_generate_portfolio` command; the release routine now names the
  tracking-file updates.

### Changed
- `README.md` tidied: the install commands are no longer printed twice, the
  `STATUS.md` frontmatter example shows every key, and the fresh-eyes pass /
  un-exclude behaviours are listed.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-08-30

### Changed
- An **excluded** folder (in `trackignore.txt`) that the user asks to track
  is now offered an un-exclude + bootstrap, instead of leaving a manual
  `trackignore.txt` edit. If it is an *ancestor* that is ignored, Claude
  explains that un-ignoring the whole subtree is the only option and asks.
  Bringing the folder up for anything else is unchanged.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-08-30

### Added
- **Fresh-eyes readability pass.** After substantially writing or rewriting
  an onboarding file (`README.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `ARCHITECTURE.md` /
  `GLOSSARY.md`), Claude runs a review pass — a subagent (inline fallback)
  checks it against the file's reader definition for a clear hook, a
  reachable quick start, jargon introduced before use, drift from the
  file's purpose, concreteness, and over-long sections. Advisory, never a
  gate; runs at bootstrap and on later rewrites. See
  `references/writing-tracking-files.md`.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-08-30

### Changed
- `GLOSSARY.md` is no longer asked at bootstrap. It is created on first
  need: a proactive check on the first session (Claude glances at the code
  / `README`, proposes the file with the terms it spotted if the project
  has a real vocabulary), plus in-session triggers — the user asks what a
  project-specific term means, or a term keeps coming up undefined. A
  single term is added and announced without a question; the proactive
  batch is proposed. New `glossary` frontmatter key (`"non"` = proactive
  scan declined; absent = not yet checked). `ARCHITECTURE.md` is still
  offered at bootstrap.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-08-30

### Changed
- `generate_portfolio.py` HTML escaping goes through `_attr()` / `_txt()`
  helpers chosen by context (attribute vs element text), so a future
  locale's apostrophes and quotes can't break an attribute or clutter a
  text node. No change to the rendered output for `en` / `fr`.
- `writing-tracking-files.md`: the stale "French repo → French tracking
  files" heuristic is replaced — the language is resolved from the
  settings, and a French repo is only a hint for the first-run question.
- `references/i18n/en.md` is stated as the source of truth for heading
  wording, its ROADMAP keys reconciled with `backlog-phases.md`
  (`in_progress` / `after` added, phase-dependence noted).
- `_normalise_lang` drops the off-spec `eng` / `fra` aliases; the accepted
  set is exactly the spec's (`en`/`english`/`anglais`,
  `fr`/`french`/`francais`/`français`), now covered by a test.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-08-30

### Added
- **User-selectable output language (English / French).**
  `~/.claude/project-tracker/language.txt` sets the machine default for the
  tracking files, the portfolio and the reminders; `language:` in a
  `STATUS.md` frontmatter overrides it for that project's files; a `language:`
  line in `portfolio.txt` overrides it for the portfolio. Per-language string
  catalogue `references/i18n/{en,fr}.md`; `generate_portfolio.py` renders its
  chrome (status labels, freshness, empty state, search, `<html lang>`) in the
  resolved language. Changing a project's language proposes a full
  retranslation (past append-only entries included, dates preserved) with an
  autonomous subagent review loop. Asked once at first bootstrap. `/project-tracker:config`
  gains a "Change the language" action. Default and fallback: `en`.
- Versioning policy written down: the scheme in this file's header, the
  release routine in `CLAUDE.md` § Releasing. `writing-tracking-files.md`
  points future projects to the same two homes (no dedicated file).

## [0.3.1] — 2026-08-30

### Added
- `references/writing-tracking-files.md` — per-file guidance on how to write
  each of the nine standard files (plus `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `GLOSSARY.md`):
  who the reader is, structure, what belongs and what doesn't, worked
  good/poor examples, and — for `ARCHITECTURE.md` — a lens for judging the
  architecture itself. `SKILL.md` points to it from "The standard files".
- `SKILL.md` now states that the tracking files are committed like any other
  source (with the narrow sensitive-content exception).
- Retroactive git tags `v0.1.0` / `v0.2.0` / `v0.3.0` (last commit of each
  version line); tagging is now part of the release routine.

### Fixed
- `SKILL.md` referenced "bootstrap step 6" for the optional
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `GLOSSARY.md` files — it is step 7.
- `build_installer.sh` had a hardcoded reference-file list; it now globs
  `references/*.md` so a new one is always bundled (see `ERRORS.md`).

### Changed
- README restructured for first-time readers: plain-language hook, a
  Quick start section up top, a tight "What you get", and the edge-case
  material (no-git mode, retrofit, concurrent sessions, optional files,
  frontmatter) moved into a "Details" section.
- README also documents `~`/`$VAR` expansion in the config files.
- `SKILL.md` § Portfolio now documents the `title:` line and the `.html`
  explicit-path tolerance of `portfolio.txt`.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-08-30

### Added
- `/project-tracker:config` command to view and change configuration
  (scopes, ignored paths, portfolio location/title, a project's category).
- Configurable portfolio title (`title:` line in `portfolio.txt`).

### Changed
- `project:` frontmatter is always the folder's own name — never asked.
- Skill no longer requests an `allowed-tools` grant.
- Audit fixes across the skill and hooks; installer regenerated.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-30

### Added
- Portfolio groups projects into sections by the `category` frontmatter
  field; bootstrap asks for a category.
- Portfolio location asked once at first bootstrap
  (`~/.claude/project-tracker/portfolio.txt`).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-30

### Added
- First Claude Code **plugin** release: `.claude-plugin/{plugin,marketplace}.json`
  + `hooks/hooks.json` bundle the skill and its three hooks (`SessionStart`,
  two `PostToolUse`). `install-project-tracker.sh` kept as a parallel path.
- Unified `PORTFOLIO.html` aggregating all tracked projects across every
  scope, regenerated by a deterministic `PostToolUse` hook.
- Self-relative hook scripts (work in plugin / skills-dir / script modes).
- `test_plugin_manifest.py`.
